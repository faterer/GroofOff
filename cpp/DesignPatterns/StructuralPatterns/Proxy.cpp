// Proxy
// The Proxy Pattern will provide an object a surrogate or placeholder for another object to 
// control access to it. It is used when you need to represent a complex object with a simpler one. 
// If creation of an object is expensive, it can be postponed until the very need arises and 
// meanwhile a simpler object can serve as a placeholder. This placeholder object is called the 
// “Proxy” for the complex object.
// Curiously Recurring Template
// This technique is known more widely as a mixin. Mixins are described in the literature to 
// be a powerful tool for expressing abstractions[citation needed].
// Interface-based Programming (IBP)
// Interface-based programming is closely related with Modular Programming and Object-Oriented 
// Programming, it defines the application as a collection of inter-coupled modules 
// (interconnected and which plug into each other via interface). Modules can be unplugged, replaced, or 
// upgraded, without the need of compromising the contents of other modules.
// The total system complexity is greatly reduced. Interface Based Programming adds more to 
// modular Programming in that it insists that Interfaces are to be added to these modules. 
// The entire system is thus viewed as Components and the interfaces that helps them to co-act.
// Interface-based Programming increases the modularity of the application and hence its 
// maintainability at a later development cycles, especially when each module must be developed 
// by different teams. It is a well-known methodology that has been around for a long time and 
// it is a core technology behind frameworks such as CORBA.
// This is particularly convenient when third parties develop additional components for the 
// established system. They just have to develop components that satisfy the interface specified 
// by the parent application vendor.
// Thus the publisher of the interfaces assures that he will not change the interface and the 
// subscriber agrees to implement the interface as whole without any deviation. An interface 
// is therefore said to be a Contractual agreement and the programming paradigm based on this 
// is termed as "interface based programming".
